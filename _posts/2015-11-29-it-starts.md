title: Finally, My Blog!
---

I tried blogging a couple of times and used blogging platforms like [Blogger](https://www.blogger.com), 
[Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/) and [Ghost](https://ghost.org/). While Blogger and Wordpress were way too cumbersome
to use, Ghost worked like a charm and it still is my favourite blogging platform. Moreover, its free and open source. 
The only problem with Ghost is that it's built on Node.js and so i wasn't able to find a free and reliable web hosting
service for Ghost. So my experiments for a decent blogging platform continued until i found Github Pages and 
[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).

  > Jekyll is a simple, blog aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory [...] and spits out a complete, static website suitable for serving with Apache or your favorite web server. This is also the engine behind GitHub Pages, which you can use to host your projectâ€™s page or blog right here from GitHub.
 
Initially, i was a bit overwhelmed by the learning curve and the amount of time and effort it took to set up the blog
and kind of left it but then i found this amazing github repo: [Poole](https://github.com/poole/poole) and they literally
took the pain of setting up the entire blog in no time. So here i am today, blogging away on Github pages and it all 
started with the help of Poole to get the initial setup done for me.

However, this wasn't enough. I have my website hosted on the link `zishanahmad.github.io` and the blog had to be hosted
on the url `zishanahmad.github.io/blog` and this created a lot of confusion for me. 

The first thing to understand was that i need to create another repository for the blog and use the `gh-pages` branch.
By setting up the blog this way, github would automatically link the blog to the url `zishanahmad.github.io/blog`. So 
i created a new repository and named it `blog` and added all the content from Poole to the repo.

Next, i had to add `baseurl: /blog/` and update the url to `url: http://zishanahmad.github.io/blog/` in the 
`_config.yml` file. This will enable Jekyll to form the correct urls.

Once this was set up, i pushed the changes to Github and viewed the blog. BUT! The CSS files were not being loaded! 
Even though the content was being shown on the screen, there was a problem in the link tags as no CSS file was being
loaded.

To fix this, the head.html file in the _includes folder had to be modified to include \{\{ site.baseurl \}\} in the 
href tag. The final link tag becomes 
`{% raw %} <link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ site.baseurl }}public/css/poole.css"> {% endraw %}`
I then proceeded the same way for all the link tags. With this fix, the CSS files were being loaded normally.

Next up was an archive page so that there is a place to view all the previous posts. So i created a file named `archive.md`
and add it to the repo. Then i added the following code to it:

```
{% raw %}
    ---
    layout: page
    title: Archive
    ---
    
    {% for post in site.posts %}
      * {{ post.date | date_to_string }} &raquo; [ {{ post.title }} ](/blog{{ post.url }})
    {% endfor %}
{% endraw %}
```

Note the `/blog` in `{% raw %} (/blog{{ post.url }}) {% endraw %}`. This is necessary as my blog is not on
`zishanahmad.github.io` but is instead on `zishanahmad.github.io/blog`. If you try to click on the posts title, then 
it won't work and the reason is the same. The url is not pointing to `/blog` and so needs to be setup. So the next thing
i did was appended `/blog` in the urls in the layout files so that it becomes: `{% raw %} <a href="/blog{{ post.url }}"> {% endraw %}`

Great! We are almost done! The final thing i did was to check all the links and make sure they were working correctly.
As it turns out, some of the links weren't working and so a slight modification had to be made. I had to add
`{% raw %} {{ site.baseurl }} {% endraw %}` in the links in order for them to point to the right location in the blog.

And there we go! A Jekyll powered blog hosted on Github is ready at your service!
